# JIgsaw Toxic Comment Kaggle Competition

Nowadays, it's difficult to chat online without reading some toxic comments. To solve this problem, an option is to social medias forbid this harmful content. One way to do so is to create machine learning algorithms that can tell us if a comment is or isn't toxic. That's our goal in this Notebook.

Given a training dataset, we will build a model to predict if a english comment is toxic. But there is another problem - the testing dataset has comments in differents languages. A solution is to translate them to English, and that's what https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky has already done for us using the Yandex.Translate's API. We will analyse the data, preprocess the comments and use a EDA Model to reach our goal.
